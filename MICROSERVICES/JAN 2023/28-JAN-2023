How to integrate microservice application with cloud configserver?
Aspart of an Microservice application we should not package the application configuration, since a change in the configuration will leads to rebuild, repackage and redeploy the application across the instances we should avoid it

Instead our Microservice application should pull the configuration information from Cloud ConfigServer during the bootup using which our application should run, how can this be achieved?
