What is the support of JEE platform in developing and delivering enterprise large scale monolithic applications?
For every enterprise large scale application we need enterprise class-level services that are common across every application
1. security
A Jee api/application server has provided built-in support for implementing security for an application through javax.security api
2. logging
Every application server supports centralized logging
3. monitoring
4. cache management
distributed caching support is provided by every jee application server
5. clustering
6. resource pooling (connection pooling)
7. global transactions
8. load balancing
9. messaging
JMS apis are supported by every jee server
10. memory management
11. schedulers
12. auditing

Instead the developing building these enterprise features, the jee platform itself has provided them
1. either through api
2. application server
