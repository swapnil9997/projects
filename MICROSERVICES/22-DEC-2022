What are Microservices?
Microservices is not an api/library or not even a programming language, its a methodology	or an architectural style of building enterprise large-scale complex business systems. The microservices architecture has provided recommendations, guidelines and design patterns that should be followed in building enterprise large-scale complex systems

In-Short:
bunch of design patterns and guidelines put together in building a large-scale complex business application is called "microservices"
