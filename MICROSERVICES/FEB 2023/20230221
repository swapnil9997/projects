The openfeign 3.x supports discovery client and loadbalancing as well. To enable loadbalancing the requests to the server we need add okHttp library 

<dependency>
	<groupId>io.github.openfeign</groupId>
	<artifactId>feign-okhttp</artifactId>
</dependency>

along with that for discovery through eureka server we should add 
1. eureka server configuration in application.yml
eureka:
	client:
		register-with-eureka: false
		fetch-registry: true
		service-url:
			defaultZone: http://localhost:8889/eureka
feign:
	okhttp:
		enabled: true
			
2. on the Application class we need to enable discovery client by annotating @EnableDiscoveryClient
3. on the interface we should not specify the url and the client name should be same as the "Service Name" in the discovery registry

@FeignClient(name="INSURANCE-SERVICE")
interface PolicyService {
}
